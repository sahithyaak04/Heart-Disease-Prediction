# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Heart disease is a big problem worldwide - indeed, it's a common reason for illness and death. Prompt and exact foresight of heart disease is key for prevention steps and personalized health care. As healthcare data grows at a rapid rate, data mining becomes a valuable tool. It helps extract useful information from complicated datasets. The goal of this project is to utilize data mining techniques. They will be used to craft a strong and effective forecast model for heart disease.

Proposed Solution for this project:
The project's primary objective is to develop an effective solution for the early prediction of heart disease, leveraging data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms. The code implements a systematic approach to address the complexity of cardiovascular health assessment, with the following proposed solution components:
1. Comprehensive Data Analysis
2. Correlation Analysis
3. Outlier Detection and Data Cleaning
4. Model Selection and Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Comparative Analysis

Model Architecture of this project:
~ Logistic Regression
~ Decision Tree
~ Naive Bayes
~ Random Forest
~ K-Nearest Neighbors
